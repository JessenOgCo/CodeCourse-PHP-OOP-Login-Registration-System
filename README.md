# CodeCourse-PHP-OOP-Login-Registration-System
This repository is the completed code for the video tutorials made by CodeCourse on Youtube for a PHP OOP Login/Registration system. This system includes functionality such as user groups, validation, tokens, user db functionality, and more.

Please note:

Some people were receiving an error when creating the column 'group' inside of the 'users' table. This problem was solved by renaming this column 'groupId'. Please make sure that when looking over this code to take into account this change. This is the only change from the original coding that was made.

All credits for this course belong to CodeCourse's Youtube Channel and subsequent people within the creation of the video tutorial series.

This code was re-written by JDsWebService and is provided to you free of charge as the video tutorials were provided free of charge.

Thanks Alex for all your hard work! Keep those tutorials coming!
